🌿 Totoro Soot Sprite Collector 🍄
Hiii! Welcome to Totoro's little adventure! ✨ This is a cute pixel art mini-game made with love, inspired by the magical world of Studio Ghibli.I made it just for fun so don't expect too much huhu, it's just a simple game btw. So come on, help Totoro collect the adorable Soot Sprites!

✨ What's Special?
Cute Pixel Art: Classic retro visuals that'll make you smile!

A Living Totoro! He can walk around, move a bit, and even fall asleep if you leave him alone~ 😴 Oh, and the Soot Sprites can spin too!

Easy Controls: Just use the Arrow Keys or WASD.

Collect Soot Sprites: Every time you touch a Soot Sprite, your score goes up! Yay! 🎉

Cute Desktop App: It's not just for browsers, it's a real desktop app made with Electron! You can shrink it or hide it too! 💖

Sounds & Music: To make the game even more fun and relaxing! 🎶

🕹️ How to Play & Enjoy
Run the totoro-game.exe application from the packaged folder (check in dist/totoro-game-win32-x64).

When "Totoro Awaits!" pops up, click the "Start Game" button! (This is important to get the music playing 🤫)

Move Totoro around using the arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) or WASD (W A S D).

Chase and touch the Soot Sprites! Every time you get one, your score increases!

If Totoro gets tired, he'll take a nap~ But if you move him again, he'll wake right up! 🏃💨
