## ✨ What's Special?
**Cute Pixel Art:** Classic retro visuals that'll make you smile!

**A Living Totoro!** He can walk around, move a bit, and even fall asleep if you leave him alone~ 😴 Oh, and the Soot Sprites can spin too!

**Easy Controls:** Just use the Arrow Keys or WASD.

**Collect Soot Sprites:** Every time you touch a Soot Sprite, your score goes up! Yay! 🎉

**Cute Desktop App:** It's not just for browsers, it's a real desktop app made with Electron! You can shrink it or hide it too! 💖

**Sounds & Music:** To make the game even more fun and relaxing! 🎶

## 🕹️ How to Play & Enjoy
1\. Run the totoro-game.exe application from the packaged folder (check in dist/totoro-game-win32-x64).

2\. When "Totoro Awaits!" pops up, click the "Start Game" button! (This is important to get the music playing 🤫)

3\. Move Totoro around using the arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) or WASD (W A S D).

4\. Chase and touch the Soot Sprites! Every time you get one, your score increases!

5\. If Totoro gets tired, he'll take a nap~ But if you move him again, he'll wake right up! 🏃💨
